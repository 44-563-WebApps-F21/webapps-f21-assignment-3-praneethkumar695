        <h2>My favorite place is New York</h2>
        <p>It was my dream to visit there, tourism in New York City is at its peak.
            Many visitors come there for the sake of witnessing the beautiful scenes and sights.
            The places include the Empire State Building, Ellis Island, <b>Times Square</b>, Statue of Liberty, 
            <b>Niagara falls </b>attracts me so much.</p>

                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem">The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: 
                    given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them. The closest pair 
                    problem for points in the Euclidean plane was among the first geometric problems that were treated at the origins 
                    of the systematic study of the computational complexity of geometric algorithms.</blockquote>
